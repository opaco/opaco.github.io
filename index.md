## Welcome to my website

I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. I am interested using computational methods to study a broad range of pheneomena.






### Research 



For my PhD research, working in a group led by Mateusz Ruszkowski, I study the processes that shape the thermal and dynamical structure of galaxies, specifically the effect of cosmic rays.  Additionally, I examine the observationally relevant predictions made from these simulations, and how these predictions change based on assumptions made in post-processing.



### Hobbies

In my spare time, I play enjoy playing sports (soccer and basketball), running, and playing board games.
