## Welcome to my website

I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. I am interested using computational methods to study a broad range of pheneomena.


[About me](https://opaco.github.io/about/)




### Research 



For my PhD research, I have studied the processes that shape the thermal and dynamical structure of galaxies. Specifically, I focused on the effect of cosmic rays.  Additionally, I have explored the observationally relevant predictions made from these simulations, and how these predictions change based on assumptions made in post-processing.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/opaco/opaco.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/opaco/opaco.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
