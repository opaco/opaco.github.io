## Research

### Simulations of galaxies



#### Simulations and observational predictions

#### Galaxies, cosmic rays, and turbulence

Cosmic rays are high-energy charged particles, primarily single protons and electrons, that are found across the galaxy. They are accelerated in supernova shocks to releavistic energies. The cosmic ray energy density in the interstellar medium is similar to the turbulent and magnetic components of energy, which suggests that they may play a role determining galactic structure.
