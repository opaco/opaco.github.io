### About me


I am currently an Astronomy PhD student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. 

I previously completed my undergraduate studies at MIT, where I majored in physics. I primarily followed the theoretical physics path, but had the chance to complete courses in geophysics, mechanical engineering, and aerospace engineering. Outside of academics, I managed to participate in (at least) 24 half-semester boot camp PE classes. I also played intramural basketball with the MIT Club of Boston alumni team all four years.

I grew up in Eagle, CO where I snowboarded occasionally and was a varsity athlete in soccer and basketball.
